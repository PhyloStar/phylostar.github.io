# Publications & Research Overview

I did my PhD in Graduate School in Language Technology, Sweden. Then, a postdoc with [Gerhard Jaeger](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities/departments/modern-languages/department-of-linguistics/chairs/general-linguistics/staff/prof-dr-gerhard-jaeger/) at University of Tuebingen. Then, another postdoc in healthcare at [University of Oslo](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/groups/ltg/) until 2019. Then, I was a faculty for few years at the University of North Texas, Denton, TX. My PhD thesis is [here].(https://github.com/PhyloStar/phylostar.github.io/blob/main/taraka_thesis.pdf) I worked with [Soeren Wichmann](https://soerenwichmann.com/) a lot and did some exciting work on language change.

## Selected Publications

### **[Tübingen-Oslo at SemEval-201-8 Task 2: SVMs Perform Better Than RNNs in Emoji Prediction](https://aclanthology.org/S18-1004/)**  
Demonstrates that SVMs outperform RNN models on emoji prediction tasks. 

### **[Are Sounds Sound for Phylogenetic Reconstruction?](https://aclanthology.org/2024.sigtyp-1.11/)**  
Finds that cognate-based phylogenies outperform sound-based methods for reconstructing language histories.

### **[Probing Multilingual BERT for Genetic and Typological Signals](https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.105/)**  
Shows that mBERT encodes genealogical and typological information; produces language distance matrices and phylogenetic trees.

### **[Disentangling Dialects: A Neural Approach to Indo-Aryan Historical Phonology and Subgrouping](https://aclanthology.org/2020.conll-1.50/)**  
Uses LSTM encoder–decoders to model sound change and subgroup Indo-Aryan languages.

### **[An Automated Framework for Fast Cognate Detection and Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1627/)**  
Proposes a scalable pipeline combining automated cognate detection with Bayesian phylogenetics.

### **[Similarity-Dependent Chinese Restaurant Process for Cognate Identification in Multilingual Wordlists](https://aclanthology.org/K18-1027/)**  
A threshold-free clustering method for cognate detection across multilingual datasets.

### **[Are Automatic Methods for Cognate Detection Good Enough for Phylogenetic Reconstruction?](https://aclanthology.org/N18-2063/)**  
Evaluates automatic vs. expert cognate sets for phylogenetic tree building.

### **[Experiments with Universal CEFR Classification](https://aclanthology.org/W18-0515/)**  
Cross-lingual CEFR proficiency classification across learner languages.

### **[Computational Analysis of Gondi Dialects](https://aclanthology.org/W17-1203/)**  
Combines dialectometry and neural modeling to analyze dialect variation.

### **[A Telugu Treebank Based on a Grammar Book](https://aclanthology.org/W17-7616/)**  
Develops a Telugu treebank using grammar-based annotation.
